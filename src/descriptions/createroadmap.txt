Establish a durable project roadmap with a high-level spec and task list. Provides shared context across sessions and Task tool subagents.

Use when:
- After a heavy planning session to lock in the spec and task list
- When launching Task tool subagents that need shared context
- User says "roadmap", "plan the project", "phases", or "milestones"
- Deliverables group naturally into distinct features

When launching Task tool subagents, explicitly instruct them to: (1) call readroadmap first, and (2) call updateroadmap to mark their action in_progress at start and completed at finish with a short note.

Structure: Features contain Actions. IDs are immutable once created.

Inputs:
- feature: short label for the overall roadmap
- spec: natural-language spec for the overall direction (scope, constraints, success criteria)
- features/actions: structured tasks with numbered IDs and clear, detailed descriptions

Example:
{
  "feature": "Core",
  "spec": "Build the core workflow and key integrations.",
  "features": [{
    "number": "1", "title": "Auth", "description": "User authentication system",
    "actions": [
      { "number": "1.01", "description": "Design JWT token flow and refresh strategy", "status": "pending" }
    ]
  }]
}
