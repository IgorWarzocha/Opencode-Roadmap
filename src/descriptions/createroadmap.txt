Initialize or append to project roadmap. Supports adding new features and actions to existing roadmaps.

Constraints:
1. Append-only: New IDs must follow sequence (Feature 1->2, Action 1.01->1.02).
2. ID Format: Feature "1", Action "1.01".
3. Validation: Action prefix MUST match Feature (Action "1.01" belongs to Feature "1").
4. Immutability: Cannot modify existing items.
5. Status: Must be "pending".

Example:
{
  "features": [
    {
      "number": "1", "title": "Auth", "description": "System setup",
      "actions": [
        { "number": "1.01", "description": "DB Init", "status": "pending" }
      ]
    }
  ]
