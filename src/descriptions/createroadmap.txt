Create a new project roadmap OR append to an existing one. Use this tool to initialize project planning or add new features/actions later. Supports append-only additions: new features (e.g., '4') and new actions (e.g., '2.04'). Actions are numbered with two decimals: '1.01', '1.02', '2.01', '2.02', etc.

Usage:
- If NO roadmap exists: Creates a new one.
- If roadmap EXISTS: Appends new features/actions.
- STRICT VALIDATION: Action numbers MUST match their feature (e.g. Action "1.05" must be in Feature "1").

Roadmap Structure:
- Features: Major project components (numbered "1", "2", "3...")
- Actions: Specific work items within features (numbered "1.01", "1.02", "2.01"...)

Rules:
- All numbers must be strings
- Feature numbers: "1", "2", "3" (simple integers)
- Action numbers: "1.01", "1.02", "2.01" (feature.action with two decimals)
- All actions must start with "pending" status
- New items must be sequential (append to end)
- No duplicate numbers allowed
- Cannot modify existing items (use UpdateRoadmap for status/description)

Example:
{
  "features": [
    {
      "number": "1",
      "title": "User Authentication",
      "description": "Login and registration system",
      "actions": [
        {
          "number": "1.01",
          "description": "Create login form with email/password fields",
          "status": "pending"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
