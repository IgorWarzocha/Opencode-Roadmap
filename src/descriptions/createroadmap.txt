Establish a durable project roadmap saved to disk. Provides shared context across sessions and Task tool subagents.

Use when:
- User says "roadmap", "plan the project", "phases", or "milestones"  
- Work will be delegated to Task tool subagents that need shared context
- Deliverables group naturally into distinct features

When launching Task tool subagents, instruct them to call readroadmap first to understand their work within the broader plan.

Structure: Features contain Actions. IDs are immutable once created.

Format:
- Feature: number "1", "2", title, description
- Action: number "1.01", "1.02" (prefix matches parent feature), description, status "pending"

Example:
{
  "features": [{
    "number": "1", "title": "Auth", "description": "User authentication system",
    "actions": [
      { "number": "1.01", "description": "Design JWT token flow and refresh strategy", "status": "pending" }
    ]
  }]
}
