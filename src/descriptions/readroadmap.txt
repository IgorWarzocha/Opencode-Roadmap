Load the persisted roadmap from disk to understand project state.

When to use:
1. Before starting a major feature - read roadmap first, then plan immediate steps with todowrite
2. When launching Task tool subagents - instruct them to call readroadmap to understand their assigned work
3. To check overall progress across features

Concurrent work awareness:
- Actions marked "in_progress" may have another agent actively working on them
- Stay focused on YOUR assigned action only - do not fix unrelated codebase errors
- Avoid modifying files that belong to another in_progress action
- If you encounter errors in code outside your scope, note them but do not fix

Returns: feature list, action statuses, completion percentages.

Filter options:
- featureNumber: show one feature and its actions
- actionNumber: show one action's details
- (omit both): full roadmap overview
