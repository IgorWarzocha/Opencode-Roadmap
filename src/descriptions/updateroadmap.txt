Advance action state within the persisted roadmap.

Statuses: pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled
Transitions: Flexible (can revert if needed), except cancelled is terminal.

Update after completing work on an action. When delegating to Task tool subagents, explicitly instruct them to call updateroadmap at start (set in_progress) and at finish (set completed with a short note).

Archives roadmap automatically when all actions reach completed.

Input: actionNumber (required), status (optional), description (optional).
