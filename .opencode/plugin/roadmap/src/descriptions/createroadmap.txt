Initialize or append to project roadmap. Supports adding new features and actions.

Constraints:
1. Descriptions: MUST be detailed, clear, and actionable (unlike the minimal example below).
2. Append-only: New IDs must follow sequence (Feature 1->2, Action 1.01->1.02).
3. ID Format: Feature "1", Action "1.01".
4. Validation: Action prefix MUST match Feature (Action "1.01" belongs to Feature "1").
5. Status: Must be "pending".

Example:
{
  "features": [
    {
      "number": "1", "title": "Auth", "description": "User authentication system setup",
      "actions": [
        { "number": "1.01", "description": "Initialize PostgreSQL database schema with users table and indexes", "status": "pending" }
      ]
    }
  ]
